SHAD Real-Time Messaging App
This app lets you see messages you receive on SHAD in real-time via a WebSocket-based web interface.

How It Works
The app uses the SHAD API to listen for new messages.
New messages are broadcasted via a WebSocket server.
A web page displays these messages in real-time using a predefined chat message template.
HOW TO RUN IT:
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Step 3: Edit the SHADIntegration.php file and replace the placeholder with your SHAD account information (enter your phone number).
Step 4: Run the Application by opening the run1.bat and run2.bat
Step 5: Enter SHAD Verification Code
